Previous Agenda: [2015-09-09](./20150909_agenda.md)

[Task Review](https://trello.com/b/efNEYNJ1/18f-testing-grouplet)

## `.about.yml`/Team API

* Catching on like wildfire. Greg Boone's eager to have it feed 18f-site as
  well.
* Hub integration should be ready hopefully this week
* Better `type:` taxonomy?
  * Per Shawn: maybe make it more tag-based, rather than one particular `type:`

## Project dashboard

* Status? Next steps?
  * Trying to optimize for out-of-memory issues
  * Burning down https://github.com/18F/github-dashing/issues

## Case Studies

* [WIP FBOpen Legacy Testing PR](https://github.com/18F/wg-testing/pull/19)

## Guides/18F Edu

* We can probably get Emileigh, Andre, and/or Kate to help us finally polish
  our wares
* Mike still plans to write up a Node/Mocha/Chai walkthrough...
* Need to update wg-testing's sidebar to point to both old and new agendas,
  maybe incorporate them into the site somehow?
