# 2015-09-23 Testing Grouplet Agenda

Previous Agenda: [2015-09-16](./20150916.md)

[Task Review](https://trello.com/b/efNEYNJ1/18f-testing-grouplet)

## `.about.yml`/Team API

* Better `type:` taxonomy?
  * Per Shawn: maybe make it more tag-based, rather than one particular `type:`

## Project dashboard

* https://project-dashboard.18f.gov/default
* https://github.com/18F/github-dashing/issues
* We should have visualizations of percentage of Travis vs. Circle, of .about.yml adoption
  * .about.yml adoption PR: https://github.com/18F/github-dashing/pull/27
  * Folks in the group are slammed; maybe ask Jessie? (Josh will do it.)
  * Should probably "soft launch" to the team, just to generate buzz and interest and possible help. Just mention in #dev.
* Call it something other than "dashboard"
  * Repo stats? Report?

## Case Studies

* [WIP FBOpen Legacy Testing PR](https://github.com/18F/wg-testing/pull/19)
* [FEC case study](https://github.com/18F/wg-testing/pull/21/files)
  * Let's invite Kate G. to next week's meeting to talk about case study format.

## Guides/18F Edu

* Mike still plans to write up a Node/Mocha/Chai walkthrough...
  * Alison trying to get `chai-json-schema` to work. Must use `chai3-json-schema` with recent Chai versions.
* Shawn investigating several functional testing frameworks.

## Offsite next week
