## Who are we?

We are a [working
group](https://pages.18f.gov/grouplet-playbook/working-groups/) dedicated to
ensuring the long-term success of 18F development projects by cultivating the
best automated testing tools, practices, and training materials available.

## What do we do/what have we done?

We maintain the [Automated Testing
Playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/automated-testing-playbook/) (for technical
concepts and adoption strategies) and the [Testing
Cookbook](https://pages.18f.gov/testing-cookbook) (for technical details). We
initiated development of the [18F Team API](https://team-api.18f.gov/api/) and
the [.about.yml
schema](https://github.com/18F/team-api/tree/master/scripts/about/), which
will support the [18F Hub](https://hub.18f.gov/), the [18F
Dashboard](https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard/), and our [18F Testing
Dashboard](https://github.com/18F/github-dashing/). We also aim to provide
small testing "walkthrough" modules for [18F Edu](https://pages.18f.gov/edu/)
in the near future.

## Where are we/how can you reach us?

Our 18F Slack channel is #wg-testing. We hold regular meetings on Wednesdays
at 2:00pm Eastern Time.
