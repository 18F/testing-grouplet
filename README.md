# 18F Testing Grouplet

This is the repo for the 18F Testing Grouplet. This is where we will store docs, such as:

* Meeting agendas
* Research write-ups

We hope these will one day get surfaced on [The Hub](https://hub.18f.gov), but for now they reside here.

## Current TODOs

We keep track of what our Grouplet is working on here, in [Testing Grouplet Issues](https://github.com/18F/testing-grouplet).

## Testing Guides

See our other resources:

* [Automated Testing Playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/automated-testing-playbook/)
* [Automated Testing Cookbook](https://pages.18f.gov/testing-cookbook/)
